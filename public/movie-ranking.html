<h1>The Best Movies According to Miki</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>It's actually three movies. All are very adventures and exciting and presents beautifully the landscapes of Middle-Earth.</p>
<h3>The petriot</h3>
<p>This movie is about the Revolutionary War. Even though I'm not an american, when I watch this movie, I feel like I am. This movie touches my heart.</p>
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>Like the first, this is not one movie, but eight. I love all of them. They are a must every Christmas.</p>
